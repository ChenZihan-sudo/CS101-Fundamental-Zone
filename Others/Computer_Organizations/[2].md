### Directed Mapping

$Cache行号 = 主存块号\ mod \ Cache总行数$



Design of cache 

how use, where

Memory hieraching to catch up the speed of CPU,

spiral locality explain.



Design of cache, how to design our cache memory,

some number of block cache, assocaitlilly, full one-way, directed-may, set-associate

Level-associated cache structure

#### Page Fault

- OS handles I/O(secondary memory) fetching the page and updating the Page Table

- Then, restart the faulty instruction

  

  **Detailed Page Fault Handler**

- Use the faulty virtual address

- Locate page on disk

- Choose page to replaceIf dirty, write to disk first

- Read disk page into memory and update page table

- Make process runnable again

- Restart from faulty instruction

#### Dirty bit

**The dirty bit for a page is set by the hardware whenever any word or byte in the page is written into, indicating that the page has been modified**. When a page is selected for replacement, the modify bit is examined. If the bit is set, the page has been modified since it was read in from the disk.



### TLB (Translation-Lookaside Buffer)

Use TLB to Make Address Translation Fast

Use a fast **cache of PTEs** within the CPU

Just like caches, the TLB can be organized as fully associative, set associative, or directly mapped

#### TLB Miss

TLB Handler copies the PTE from memory (PT) to TLB and restart instruction

- Could be handled in hardware. Can get complex for more complicated page table structures
- Or in software. Raise a special exception, with optimized handler
